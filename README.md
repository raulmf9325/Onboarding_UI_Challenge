# Onboarding_UI_Challenge
In this challenge I implement the wireframes on onboarding.xd
To do so, I resorted to the following:
* UI built with UIKit and NSLayoutConstraints (no dependencies for auto layout)
* Modular architecture with one Application target (main target), and 2 frameworks: home module and authentication module
* Design patterns: MVC, Delegation pattern, public interfaces for each module
